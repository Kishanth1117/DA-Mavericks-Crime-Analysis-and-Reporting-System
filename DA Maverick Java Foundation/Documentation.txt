**Solution**: Implemented dynamic column detection and adaptation mechanisms that check for column existence and adapt queries accordingly.

### Challenge 2: Many-to-Many Relationships
**Problem**: Managing many-to-many relationships between incidents and cases without a junction table.
**Solution**: Implemented a flexible approach using comma-separated values in an IncidentIDs column, with the ability to add this column if it doesn't exist.

### Challenge 3: Data Type Handling
**Problem**: CHAR fields in databases often include padding with spaces, causing issues with enum conversions.
**Solution**: Added trim() operations to string values before converting to enums, ensuring proper data handling.

### Challenge 4: Error Handling
**Problem**: Various error scenarios needed specific handling to provide meaningful feedback.
**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive exception hierarchy with specific exceptions for different error scenarios.
